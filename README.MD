# lethel: funny stack-oriented esolang

basically manipulate things on a stack and etc and embedding stuff is real easy
the cons? its a pain on the ass to code on it
(reason because the name is literally my internet nickname letiul + hell)

example:
```
header std ; required so we can put spaces

push Hello ; pushes value to stack
pushval SPACE; pushes value SPACE (basically a struct but its just one value)
push World!
concat ; puts all strings toghter one by one
print ; prints last thing on stack
```

btw its a esolang because has useless keywords and funny errors
example:
```
; putting a EOF character
> @
error: what the fuck is '@'?
>

; class = quits the program lol
; main.let
class pleasedont
; console
error: oop sucks lmao
```

this has pratically no use cases but it's embeddable easily
